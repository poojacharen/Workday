-- Provides the least control over the definition of individual positions

-- One set of hiring restrictions per org apply to all jobs in the supervisory rg

-- Not required to set specific limits on the number of jobs to be filled

-- Particularly useful for orgs that prefer to define broad job requirements and rely on staffing workflow and approvals to control the number of workers in a supervisory org

-- With job management :
 - Hiring is not limited to a predefined number of openings
 - Do not need to create a separate, open position for each job you want to fill
 - Any hiring restrictions you define app;y equally to all jobs in the org
 - Moves approval for a new job to the hire process instead of position creation

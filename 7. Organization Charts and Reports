ðŸ”· What is an Org Chart in Workday?
An Org Chart (Organizational Chart) in Workday visually represents the hierarchical structure of an organization.

Who reports to whom (reporting relationships)
- Position titles and roles
- Open positions
- Management levels
- Departments or teams
 -- It helps HR and managers:
  - Understand team structures
  - Plan workforce changes
  - View vacant positions
  - Navigate the organization

ðŸ”· What is a Report in Workday?
A Report in Workday is a real-time view of data related to people, processes, or organizational structures. Workday allows users to:

- Create standard/custom reports
- Filter and export data
- Automate reporting tasks
- Use them for analytics or auditing
- Example: A report on all members of a management group, open positions, or compensation trends.

ðŸ”¹ Assigned
- Definition: Directly given or set by an admin or user.
- Example: You manually assign the "HR Partner" role to Priya for the Finance department.
- Effect: The user has access or responsibility only because it was explicitly assigned to them.

ðŸ”¹ Inherited
- Definition: Automatically passed down from a higher level (like a parent organization or structure).
- Example: If the Finance org has an HR Partner role assigned at the top level, users in sub-orgs like "Accounts Payable" may inherit that role.
- Effect: The user has access/role because it's flowing down from a parent org or group â€” not directly assigned.
